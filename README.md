# NLP-Specialization by Deep Learning.ai 

## Topics Covered

*This Specialization will equip you with the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques needed to build cutting-edge NLP systems:*

- Use logistic regression, naïve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies, and translate words, and use locality sensitive hashing for approximate nearest neighbors.

- Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to autocorrect misspelled words, autocomplete partial sentences, and identify part-of-speech tags for words.

- Use dense and recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in TensorFlow and Trax to perform advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and to identify duplicate questions.

- Use encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention to perform advanced machine translation of complete sentences, text summarization, question-answering and to build chatbots. Models covered include T5, BERT, transformer, reformer, and more!
Enjoy!

Week 2: Naïve Bayes for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets

    Use a more advanced model for sentiment analysis

Week 3: Vector Space Models

    Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships

Week 4: Word Embeddings and Locality Sensitive Hashing for Machine Translation

    Write a simple English-to-French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbors search






Course 2: Probabilistic Models in NLP

This is the second course of the Natural Language Processing Specialization.

Week 1: Auto-correct using Minimum Edit Distance

    Create a simple auto-correct algorithm using minimum edit distance and dynamic programming

Week 2: Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging

    Apply the Viterbi algorithm for POS tagging, which is important for computational linguistics

Week 3: N-gram Language Models

    Write a better auto-complete algorithm using an N-gram model (similar models are used for translation, determining the author of a text, and speech recognition)

Week 4: Word2Vec and Stochastic Gradient Descent

    Write your own Word2Vec model that uses a neural network to compute word embeddings using a continuous bag-of-words model
    
    
    
    
    

Course 3: Sequence Models in NLP

Week 4: Siamese Networks

    Use so-called ‘Siamese’ LSTM models to compare questions in a corpus and identify those that are worded differently but have the same meaning
    
    
    
    
    
    

Course 4: Attention Models in NLP

This is the fourth course in the Natural Language Processing Specialization.
